- [✔] About Us should be listed before Press at the Footer (nice job with the changing link colours btw!)
- [✔] About Us - Under fun fact, could you change "WON" to just "won"
- [✔] About Us - "meet the rest of our teams" should be "meet the rest of the team" (Don't italicize, just wanted to shot you the copy I changed)
- [✔] Press - Put above the link: For media inquiries, please contact info@learningloop.co <- can we verify this email exists and works?  How can we check it?
- [✔] A little more space in between Press and Media Sections
- [✔] Instead of "Media" can we change to "As seen in:"
- [✔] Could the logos be listed in rows? Lots of space on the right to bring those ones up there!
